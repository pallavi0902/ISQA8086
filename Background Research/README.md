  # Background Research Report

### Linda Loring Nature Foundation
                              

Linda Loring Nature Foundation, established in 1999 at Nantucket, Massachusetts.
It focuses on three major areas of work vis-à-vis Ecological Research, Environmental
Education, and Land Stewardship. Because Linda Loring Nature Foundation does
ecological research, it became a precipitation center, monitoring multiple aspects of
precipitation at Nantucket Island. LLNF is not just a precipitation center, but it is
also a hotspot for tourists who wants to be, to help and to connect with pure, raw
nature. Nantucket island itself is a tourist place for people and LLNF is adding to
Nantucket’s touristy charm. LLNF offers various Ecology camps, Bird walk, Science
picnic, nature walk, animal-plant specific programs, etc. and this are all offered to
everyone regardless of age. They make their presence on social media in order to
engage more people who would like to be in the lap of nature. Their Facebook and
Instagram handle are really well managed and updated which helps audience to
keep learning about their upcoming events. During my research, I checked their
Facebook page which has user rating of 4.8 out of 5. I also read user reviews which
were very positive. One of the user said – _“One of our favorite places to visit for a
family adventure. We especially love their seasonal Story Walks”_. Since Linda Loring
Nature Foundation is a non-profit organization, public community plays an
important role because public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a
non-profit organization is able to raise. Linda Loring Nature Foundation has
different mission, vision and goals than a profitable institution. For a non-profit
organization like LLNF, the focus is and should always be on gaining public
confidence because more the public’s confidence, more money will come to
organization. LLNF has always been focused on non-profits, which is why it attracts
a large number of audience to their fields and this is why Linda Loring Nature
foundation is keep growing and keeping their audience engaged. One of the
common misconception about non-profit’s is regarding their management. People
often thinks that because it is a non-profit, it is run by volunteers. However, nonprofits
like LLNF have proper organization staff that includes, Director, Board
members, Members, steering committee, or trustees, Researchers, Managers, and
then there are volunteers. LLNF or any other non-profit organization, in many
aspects are similar to profitable institution. Another management aspect of Linda
Loring Nature Foundation is their ethical standards and practices. LLNF is well
established from 1999 to until now, it may be a non-profit organization having
different goals and vision but when it comes to practicing ethical business practices,
LLNF is doing a good job. An organization cannot survive for a long time if they are
not following business ethics. In the long run, an organization to be successful needs
to do all its organization’s work process in an ethical and standard manner.
Organization’s often to grow fast take paths of unethical practices which eventually
lead the organization to fall. Like any other non-profit organization, Linda Loring
Nature Foundation manage its sustainability by establishing strong relations with
various donor groups. To establish relations with donors, it takes strong donor
marketing strategy. So, it is not that if an organization is non-profit, they would
simply be getting volunteers, donors, funds all automatically but to get all this, 
organization need to work hard and together in a management setting because that
is what it takes for an organization to drive a shared goal and it doesn’t matter
whether it is a non-profit organization like LLNF or a profitable institution. One of
the biggest and memorable donation Linda Loring Nature Foundation got was in
year 2017, 18-acre tract was donated to LLNF by Nature Conservancy.

We chose Linda Loring Nature Foundation phenology dataset as our area of research
and data analysis project. Phenology, according to Phenological Research book, is
the study of the timing of recurring biological events”. So, when I was researching
for phenological area of study which relevant to our project, I came across ‘Plant
phenological research enhances ecological restoration’ article. From this article, I
learned about a very important aspect of phenology research which could be helpful
to Linda Loring Nature Foundation in terms of **conservation science and
management**. Like the title of the article suggests, it emphasis on ecological
restoration through plant phenological research. Two of our research question are
directly related to plant phenological data provided by Linda Loring Nature
Foundation-- first, “Where do leafing activities occur the most among 8 sites?”,
second, “How do breaking buds vary from year to year?”. Because our data analysis
focused more on plant phenological side, I would like to bring this article in light.
The article talks about five key steps of restoration projects- 1) Establish the
reference 2) obtain biotic resources, 3) Implement the selected restorations
methods, 4) Set up permanent monitoring 5) Implement adaptive management.
These steps are further divided into various steps explaining importance of each.
Highlight is that this framework not just educate about ecological restoration but
also, how restoring of ecological restoration can contribute to phenological research
by offering insightful information which can help Linda Loring Nature Foundation
to explore innovative questions on drivers and patterns in phenology. Article
suggests gathering of local plant material, because they are best for carrying out
restoration, which can be an easy task for LLNF as it has 104 acre of local landscape
in its possession which is dedicated to plants and animals. It is to be noted,
according to Miller et al. 2011, that Information on the dates of budbreak,
germination, flowering and/or seed set, and on flower abundance have proven
essential to guarantee that using locally adapted seed sources preserves adequate
phenological cycles and to ensure the reproductive success of introduced species.
Furthermore, according to Hagen et al. 2012, leaf, flower and fruit phenologies link
plants to herbivores, pollinators, frugivores, and seed dispersers, studying plant
phenology involves taking into account resource availability and interaction
networks, encompassing ecosystem and landscape complexity. One of the instances
given by Garcia et al. 2014, phenology can provide restorationists with a method that
selects plant species based on the timing of fruiting. This method will help them to
attract potential seed dispersers and provide fruits all year long. These kind of
methods can really help Linda Loring Nature Foundation to increase efficiency 
because experimenting new and innovative methods will bring a lot of enthusiasm,
freshness and energy in their researches.

One more topic that I would like to bring to the light of my report is regarding Linda
Loring Nature Foundation advocacy and policy. I happened to read ‘A guide to
measure Advocacy and Policy’, from which I learned that non-profit organizations
and foundations measure their advocacy and policy work as there is no common
evaluation approach exists in present. As Linda Loring Nature Foundation is a nonprofit
organization, I propose measurement of their advocacy and policy work which
will help them to learn about beneficial outcomes of advocacy and policies.
Moreover, according to the article, advocacy and policy work can offer evaluation
design suggestions that include a broad range of methodologies, intensities,
audiences, timeframes, and purposes. Organizational Research Services (ORS)
stated six categories vis-à-vis shifts in social norms, strengthening organizational
capacity, strengthened alliances, strengthened base of support, improved policies,
change in impact, which represents how advocacy and policy work can lead to
changing communities, organization management and its system.
